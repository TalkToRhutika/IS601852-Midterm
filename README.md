## Project Overview
The **Advanced Python Calculator** provides a **command-line interface (REPL)** for performing arithmetic operations, managing calculation history, and dynamically integrating plugins for extended functionality. It employs **Pandas for advanced data handling** and **logging for professional-grade application tracking**.

---

## Core Functionalities
This application features a **REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)** that supports:
**Arithmetic Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
**History Management:** Show, save, clear, and delete history entries.  
**Extensibility:** Integrate dynamically loaded plugins for enhanced features.  

---

## Plugin System
The calculator follows a **modular plugin system**, allowing seamless **integration of new commands or features**:
**Dynamically load and integrate plugins** without modifying the core application.  
**View available plugins using a menu command** inside the REPL.  

---

## Calculation History Management (with Pandas)
The **calculation history is managed using Pandas**, enabling:  
**Loading and displaying history from a CSV file.**  
**Saving the current history to a CSV file.**  
**Clearing or deleting specific history entries,** with real-time updates in the CSV file.  

---

## Advanced Data Handling with Pandas
Pandas is leveraged for:
**Efficient reading/writing of calculation history to CSV files.**  
**Ensuring robust and scalable data management.**  

---

## Professional Logging Practices
A **comprehensive logging system** is implemented to track:
**Detailed application operations and data manipulations.**  
**Warnings and errors for debugging.**  
**Log messages with different severity levels (INFO, WARNING, ERROR).**  

The logging system is configurable via **environment variables**, allowing customization of logging levels and output destinations.

---

## Scalable Architecture with Design Patterns
The calculator employs **industry-standard design patterns** for better **scalability and maintainability**:
- **Facade Pattern:** Simplifies complex Pandas data manipulations.
- **Command Pattern:** Structures REPL commands for efficient execution.
- **Factory Method, Singleton, and Strategy Patterns:** Enhances modularity, flexibility, and reusability.

## Testing and Code Quality
**Minimum 94% test coverage** using **Pytest**.  
Code quality adheres to **PEP 8 standards**, validated using **Pylint**.  

---

## Documentation
